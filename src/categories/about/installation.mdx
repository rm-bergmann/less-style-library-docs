import CodeBlock from '../../components/codeBlock/codeBlock';

Install into your project using yarn or npm.

<div className="code-block">
  <CodeBlock>
    npm install less-style-library --save-dev
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

<div className="code-block">
  <CodeBlock>
    yarn add less-style-library
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

<div className={`code-block__description`}>
  Import the library using a less / css import statement. This should be imported
  before all other less files in your project so that you can override any predefined
  variables and settings if needed.
</div>

<div className="code-block">
  <CodeBlock>
    @import './node_modules/less-style-library/imports.less';
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

## Using with React or similar component architecture

### Option 1  

<div className={`code-block__description`}>
  In the app index.js file you can import a style.less file, which imports this 
  library. The style.less file can automatically import each component.less file
  which compiles a css file that is linked to the application html files.
</div>  

### Option 2  

<div className={`code-block__description`}>
  The method above is great for stylesheet evaluation as a whole, but there is a 
  slight disadvantage as the compiled stylesheet will have all styles for all pages
  in a website or application, so large stylesheets could cause a slight performnce 
  setback on the first pageload. Once the stylesheet is cached in the browser pageload
  performance is fine. This is mostly useful for a layout.css file which is needed on 
  all pages of a website. React Frameworks like Next JS and Gatsby can compile static html files in a way where
  each page only loads the css needed for the page. To use this library with that type
  of architecture the library would need to be imported in each component where a mixin
  or variable from this library is used. That would be teadious to do manually. To automatically import the library in all React components you would need to write
  a custom webpack loader that automatically imports the library.
