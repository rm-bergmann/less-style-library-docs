CSS has a large [list of color variable names][1] already built in,
but they are not easy to memorize unless you use them frequently.

Less Style Library includes color variables in object format which 
makes it easy to change shades of a particular color, which is useful
when experimenting with different colour shades.

The variable naming follows this pattern:

<CodeBlock mixinName={`colors`}>
  @colorname-colortype[shade-number]
</CodeBlock>

There is no specific order of shade numbers
