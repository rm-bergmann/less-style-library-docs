### Apply these grid mixins to the grid items inside the grid cotainer:

Default will start at column 1 and end at column 12.

<CodeBlock mixinName={`grid`}>
  #grid.column();
</CodeBlock>

You can customize your start / end points by specifying them.
Lets say we want to start at column 2 and end at column 4:

<CodeBlock mixinName={`grid`}>
  #grid.column(2, 4);
</CodeBlock>

We can also specify the row start / row end like this:
Default will start at row 1 and end at row 2, but we can speficy any row start and end points:

<CodeBlock mixinName={`grid`}>
  #grid.row();
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock mixinName={`grid`}>
  #grid.row(3, 5);
</CodeBlock>
  
If you want an element to span across the whole row from left to right use this mixin:

<CodeBlock mixinName={`grid`}>
   #grid.column(across);
</CodeBlock>

If that does not work, you can specify how many columns to span by.
Default starts at column 1 and spans 12 columns.
You can speicfy the start columns and the amount of columns you want to span by. Lets start at column 2 and span 6:

<CodeBlock mixinName={`grid`}>
   #grid.column(span);
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock mixinName={`grid`}>
   #grid.column(span, 2, 6);
</CodeBlock>

When designing responsive sites we may have columns stacked on top of eachother on mobile devices,
and beside eachother on tablet devices and desktop screens. I have designed some customizeable mixins which
do this work for you.

By default, on tablet and desktop devices we start at column 1 and span 2.
We can specify the start column and amount to span the element by. Lets start at column 6 and span 4:

<CodeBlock mixinName={`grid`}>
   #grid.column(responsive);
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock mixinName={`grid`}>
  #grid.column(responsive, 6, 4);
</CodeBlock>

Useful mixin to change both Grid column and row gaps at the same time.
Both column and row gaps must have the same value.

<CodeBlock mixinName={`grid`}>
  #grid.gap(20px);
</CodeBlock>
